Software Development Engineer,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Drishti Technologies,None,Organic,"Join Drishti to solve a 100-year-old problem in a $12 trillion dollar market.
Deep learning-driven action recognition is the next frontier for AI. Build it with us.

Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world.” We’re driving true digital transformation in manufacturing by, for the first time since Henry Ford, making manual processes visible to factory analytics. We’re producing, collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data as we build manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.

About this role

A software development engineer at Drishti will make the connection between the data our systems create and the insights our customers need. You will work with the latest technologies and tools – including artificial intelligence, deep learning and computer vision – as you assist in the design, development, testing and support of all our internal and customer-facing systems. In this position, you must be familiar and comfortable with all aspects of the software design lifecycle, and both willing to engage in discussions at the highest level and immediately transition to executing with perfect attention to detail.

Minimum qualifications

Bachelors in Computer Science or related disciplines
Solid computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, design principles
Proficient in at least one programming language: Python / C++ / Java
Solid understanding of database fundamentals: indexing, sharding
Preferred qualifications

Master’s in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience
Experience building scalable REST APIs, microservice architectures
Hands-on experience using databases in production (MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, etc)
Experience with multi-threading, parallel programming
Experience with large scale distributed systems (Hadoop, HBase, MapReduce, Spark, Storm)
Experience with Cloud Platforms (GCP / AWS), Kubernetes, Docker
Five reasons to work at Drishti

1. Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
2. Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
3. Do what you love — solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
4. Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is based in Silicon Valley, and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital and BGV. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the center of the action.
5. Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field."

Software Development Engineer,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Drishti Technologies,None,Organic,"Join Drishti to solve a 100-year-old problem in a $12 trillion dollar market.
Deep learning-driven action recognition is the next frontier for AI. Build it with us.

Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world.” We’re driving true digital transformation in manufacturing by, for the first time since Henry Ford, making manual processes visible to factory analytics. We’re producing, collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data as we build manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.

About this role

A software development engineer at Drishti will make the connection between the data our systems create and the insights our customers need. You will work with the latest technologies and tools – including artificial intelligence, deep learning and computer vision – as you assist in the design, development, testing and support of all our internal and customer-facing systems. In this position, you must be familiar and comfortable with all aspects of the software design lifecycle, and both willing to engage in discussions at the highest level and immediately transition to executing with perfect attention to detail.

Minimum qualifications

Bachelors in Computer Science or related disciplines
Solid computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, design principles
Proficient in at least one programming language: Python / C++ / Java
Solid understanding of database fundamentals: indexing, sharding
Preferred qualifications

Master’s in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience
Experience building scalable REST APIs, microservice architectures
Hands-on experience using databases in production (MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, etc)
Experience with multi-threading, parallel programming
Experience with large scale distributed systems (Hadoop, HBase, MapReduce, Spark, Storm)
Experience with Cloud Platforms (GCP / AWS), Kubernetes, Docker
Five reasons to work at Drishti

1. Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
2. Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
3. Do what you love — solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
4. Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is based in Silicon Valley, and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital and BGV. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the center of the action.
5. Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field."

About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.

About Us
Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Lower Manhattan, Accrete.AI is an artificial intelligence company that builds proprietary dynamic learning technologies called Knowledge Functions designed to boost analytical productivity. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions comprise of latent mathematical representations of tacit human knowledge that seed models that dynamically recalibrate neural architectures on the fly with minimal feedback, resolving issues related to catastrophic forgetting. As a result, Accrete’s Knowledge Functions capture and scale tacit knowledge by enabling machines to accurately understand and adapt to changing contexts. Accrete’s Knowledge Functions are powering domain specific applications that accurately filter self-promotion to identify authentically engaged users; gauge influence to predict viral potential; track the propagation of rumors; and more.
Backed in part by Dr. David Magerman, who helped found the equities trading group at the world leading quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, Accrete.AI began by building and licensing applications that would help financial analysts predict market-moving merger and acquisition rumors and transcribe and analyze scores of earnings calls simultaneously in real time with human level granularity and accuracy. Accrete has since expanded its stable of Knowledge Functions to build and license smart analytical tools across a variety of industries beyond financial services such as defense, real estate, music and collectibles.
We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.
In addition, based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.
If you’re the right person for the job, we look forward to hearing from you."

C++ Software Engineer (India),"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Suki,None,Organic,"What we want to accomplish and why we're hiring you
Suki is creating a new category in the health tech space - the digital assistant. We are going to be the voice user interface for healthcare. What does that mean exactly? Currently doctors use their electronic medical record system to track patient encounters (a digital version of the old paper charts you use to see in the doctor's office and on TV). These systems can be hard to navigate and creating medical notes in these systems can be very time consuming. Time that a doctor would rather have to spend with patients. This is the problem we're solving right now! Doctors that use Suki spend 50%+ less time on administrative tasks and we are striving to do even more.
We are a product driven company. Suki has one product running as a single service and we are focused on making that world class. Our platform team consists of DevOps, security, platform and back-end engineers that are committed to reliably and securely scaling our cloud platform to enable the rest of our engineering team. The team enables other engineering teams to work efficiently and provide standardized tooling, including monitoring, logging, etc.. We own the voice stack that powers the digital assistant. Our tech stack includes: Terraform, Kubernetes, GoLang, Python and various GCP services and we're going to scale it to support millions of hours of real-time streaming voice.
What will you do everyday?
You'll figure out the best way to standardize everything and constantly look for ways to make improvements. You will work directly on the platform that powers our microservices. You'll help scale our platform for thousands of doctors and help improve usability. You'll implement a microservices architecture and you'll use C++ to do it all. And you'll be magnificent.
Ok, you're sold, but what are we looking for in the perfect candidate?
Expertise: You know how to code. You understand our tech stack and can be productive with it. In other words, you've done this before.
Action oriented: You love to build. You like to ship fast and quickly iterate.
Creativity: You enjoy listening to user feedback and then building product in novel ways. You're resourceful and enjoy finding alternate paths to success.
Problem solving: you use data to help point you in the correct direction. You optimize relentlessly. You think business and engineering problems are like puzzles and you stick with them until they are solved.
Humility: You're humble and love working in a team without ego to deliver products
Adaptability: You thrive in a fast-moving organization that uses light-weight process and cutting-edge technology to have a huge impact.
Confidence: You trust your abilities and you're ready to push yourself to the next level.
Requirements*
3+ years experience in a software engineering role
Proficient in C/C++
Proven ability to build and maintain distributed backend services for ML/AI Applications
Experience taking product technical design from inception to production
Strong grasp of CS fundamentals including algorithms, data structures and design is preferred
Requirements is such a strong word. We don't necessarily expect to find a candidate that has done everything we've listed, but you should be able to make a credible case that you've done most of it and are ready for the challenge of adding some new things to your resume.
Tell me more about Suki
Series B raised this year!
On a roll: Announced major partnerships with Google
Great team: Founded, managed and backed by successful veterans of Google and Apple in tech and UCSF and Stanford in medicine. We have technologists and doctors working side by side to solve difficult problems.
Great investors: We're backed by Venrock, First Round Capital, Flare Capital Partners, Marc Benioff and others.
Huge market: Disrupting a massive, growing $30+ billion market for transcription, dictation and order entry solutions - our vision is to become the voice user interface for healthcare, bringing innovation that relieves the administrative burden on doctors instead of adding to it.

Why Cisco
WE ARE CISCO
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

Analytics Software Engineer,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Logix Microsystems,None,Organic,"As a software developer with an interest in AI and analytics, you can get a job if you have some key skills to prototype, build, test, deploy and maintain software.
If you have a talent for coding, you can quickly learn Python and pandas (pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis). Python is the highest-ranked way to build analytics systems, with JavaScript for data visualization and user interfaces. There are other languages and technologies, of course, but the combination of Python and pandas gets you into a job, and then you can continue to learn while you earn.
This is how you can quickly learn Python for data analysis: https://www.udemy.com/learning-python-for-data-analysis-and-visualization/
If you acquire these skills, you can get a job in analytics.

Which means that people—who still perform up to 90% of factory activities—are effectively invisible to analytics. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger. Why join a giant tech company when you can build one from the ground up?
3. Solve a myriad of unsolved problems. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge—and the madness, and the fun—of building an SAP on top of a Youtube on top of a Nest.
4. Lead the charge from Bangalore. Drishti is based in Silicon Valley, and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital and BGV. But—and this is critical for you—Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore itself. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the center of the action.
5. Pick up deep learning. Engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field."

JAVA Lead,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Zinier,None,Organic,"Who we are
Zinier is a global company headquartered in San Mateo, California, with offices in Latin America, Singapore, Bengaluru, Australia, and Portugal and backed by leading investors including Accel Partners and Founders Fund.
Why we exist
Services shape how we live. Electricity lights up our homes. The Internet opens up our worlds. Cellular phones keep us connected no matter where we are. We take for granted the things we can turn on with the flip of a switch. But when even one of the services we depend on isn't available, the day can quickly start to go sideways.
For organizations that provide these services, some of the most important work happens in the field — in neighborhoods, across open spaces, and along millions of last miles that criss-cross the country. Every moment of downtime matters, which is why Zinier exists. Zinier empowers organizations to work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep people in the rhythm of their days.
To do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.
