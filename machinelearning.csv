Deep Learning Engineer - Platform and Infrastructure,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",Drishti Technologies,None,Organic,"Join Drishti to solve a 100-year-old problem for a $12 trillion dollar industry.
Deep learning-driven action recognition is the next frontier for AI. Build it with us.

Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world”. For the first time since Henry Ford, we’re making manual processes visible to factory analytics—by creating manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.

About this role

In this role, you will be breaking ground by partnering with some of the world’s most advanced deep learning and computer vision engineers. Your job will be to build and maintain large-scale systems to support the entire pipeline, including data collection, training, real-time inferencing of deep neural networks, and continuous improvement. You’ll also be tasked with optimizing neural networks for higher throughput and lower latencies. Your ultimate goal will be to ensure that the data created by our system is delivered to—and used by—some of the world’s largest and most influential manufacturing companies.

Minimum Qualification
Bachelors EE or CS from top tier Engineering colleges
Solid computer science fundamentals - data structures, algorithms, design principles
Solid machine learning and neural network fundamentals
Fluency in C++ or Python
Preferred Qualification
Masters/PhD in Machine Learning/Computer Science or equivalent practical experience
Hands on experience with one or more DL libraries (Caffe/ Tensorflow/ PyTorch/ Keras/ etc)
Experience deploying DL/ML models in production involving GPUs, building deep network inference as a service
Experience building dataset pipelines, model management pipelines
Prior Experience with Cloud Platforms (GCP / AWS / Azure), Kubernetes, Containerisation
Experience with ML platforms such as SeldonCore, SageMaker, CloudML
Experience with large scale distributed systems (Hadoop, HBase, MapReduce, Spark, Storm, AWS Lambda)
Top five reasons to join Drishti

1. Work with visionaries who can execute. Do some research on our leadership team. Look at their patents and their publications. See how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first-name basis with them.
2. Tackle a massive opportunity. Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people—who still perform up to 90% of factory activities—are effectively invisible to analytics. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger. Why join a giant tech company when you can build one from the ground up?
3. Solve a myriad of unsolved problems. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge—and the madness, and the fun—of building an SAP on top of a Youtube on top of a Nest.
4. Lead the charge from Bangalore. Drishti is based in Silicon Valley, and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital and BGV. But—and this is critical for you—Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore itself. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the center of the action.
5. Pick up deep learning. Engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field."

About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.

About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.

For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Background

The world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Data Scientist,"New Delhi, Delhi",Clinton Health Access Initiative,None,Organic,"Overview:
The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Background

The world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Program Overview

WJCF, in partnership with its affiliate CHAI, is supporting the COVID-19 response in the areas of testing policy, strengthened data and delivery systems, and development of guidelines. The programme has been supporting the ICMR in scaling up testing, providing data-driven insights to support supply chain management including forecasting and inventory management, and helping build guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for downstream distribution of commodities. Separately, the programme also supports selected states on localized strategies for testing scale up and equitable access, stronger engagement with the private sector, improved treatment readiness, robust awareness campaigns and capacity building initiatives, and analytics-based programme management.

Role

We seek a highly motivated individual with demonstrated analytical abilities for the role of Data Scientist based at Delhi. The Data Scientist will analyse programme data and support government stakeholders in scientific research. The Data Scientist will also be responsible for synthesizing data from multiple datasets and creating frameworks for analysing program data which can be used for informing strategic programmatic decisions. The Data Scientist will also be responsible to propose additional research and program management initiatives supported with data / data collection exercises.

A strong profile will include outstanding credentials, analytical ability, and communication skills. The candidate must be self-driven, entrepreneurial, adaptable, and have a high level of comfort with ambiguity.
