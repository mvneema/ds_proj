Anyone who at any time has made or makes any payment to any party against promises of job or selection for a job with Deloitte or any matter related to this (including those for ‘registration’, ‘verification’ or ‘security deposit’) or otherwise engages with any such person who has made or makes fraudulent promises or offers, does so (or has done so) entirely at their own risk. Deloitte takes no responsibility or liability for any such unauthorised or fraudulent actions or engagements.

B. D. Somani International School

seeks a
Head-of-School
Re-Launched for July 1, 2020
In order to create the opportunity for a more comprehensive search that will produce a highly experienced group of candidates, Search Associates and the BDSIS Board have agreed to RE-LAUNCH THE SEARCH for the first-ever Head of School for 2020. In December of 2018, the search for the Secondary Principal was completed with the appointment of Dr. Colleen Boyett who will assume her role in July of 2019 (see the announcement on the Search website). In addition, since the re-launching of the search for 2020, an Interim Head appointment for 2019/20 was explored by the B.D. Somani Board of Trustees which, in March of 2019, resulted in the selection of Dr. Geoff Fisher as Interim Head of School for 2019/20. Geoff Fisher’s appointment is separately announced under FILLED POSITIONS on the Search website. The search for a permanent Head of School for July of 2020 remains active and continues to represent a unique opportunity for leadership in this exceptional school. We invite candidates to take advantage of the gift of time and consider submitting their application for the permanent Head of School position to commence in July of 2020.
The School
The B.D. Somani International School (BDSIS) is a co-educational day school located in southern Mumbai. Currently, the school offers an international curriculum in English to over 1,000 students from the age of 3 to 18. Students are predominantly Indian and most have English as their first language. Founded in July 2006, BDSIS became the first school in southern Mumbai to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). Since then the school has successfully introduced the Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIS) for Grades 8 to 10. The lower grades use international progressive philosophy to prepare students for life-long learning and the IB Diploma.

The school attracts families who live throughout South Mumbai and desire an international education that predominantly leads to tertiary studies abroad. BDSIS has a Managing Board that currently bears the ultimate responsibility for the school and drives major policy, strategic and infrastructure decisions. The day-to-day activities are managed by two principals: Primary Principal (responsible for Reception to Grade 5) and Secondary Principal (responsible for Grades 6 to 12).
Located in one of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Mumbai, the school is situated at the nexus of history, culture and geography of the city. The school’s facilities include large, well-furnished classrooms; cutting edge laboratories; well-stocked libraries; art, music, theatre and sports facilities (including the largest school field in South Mumbai). The school aims to develop informed curiosity and a deep passion for learning among its students and faculty.

Vision and Mission
B.D. Somani International School offers its students an internationally recognised curriculum in an Indian setting. The school focuses on social as well as intellectual development of the students to equip them to take their place in the global community of the 21st century. In an atmosphere that values academic excellence, the school seeks to encourage respect for individuality and self-awareness. At B. D. Somani, we aim to nurture and develop the potential of each of our students and to prepare them to become dynamic, caring and productive members of a democratic and interdependent society.

Primary School
Within the Primary School, the curriculum is centred on building effective communication, collaborative problem-solving and reasoning skills. The learning environment requires practical application of skills, authentic and constructivist experiences, research, discussion and debate. The emphasis is on higher order thinking rather than simplistic rote learning. The arts, outdoor physical activity, IT skills and Hindi, French and Marathi are valued and embedded throughout the curriculum. As students move up to Middle School from Primary, they are confident, articulate and ready to take risks and face challenges whilst being equipped with the necessary skills to be life-long learners and thinkers.

Secondary School
In Secondary School, the curriculum is geared towards delivering a holistic education to all our students as they transition to classrooms with individual subjects taught by specialist teachers. As the students move on to the IGCSE program, there is an emphasis on research skills, teamwork and intellectual discovery. BDSIS offers a total of 18 IGCSE subjects out of which students study 8 subjects (4 mandatory and 4 optional). These subjects range from Science to Humanities to vocational subjects to provide a wide choice for all learners.

The school believes the IGCSE program to be the perfect bridge between the middle school and the IB Diploma Program. The curriculum gives students an opportunity to implement skills acquired in earlier years and to develop the traits and attitudes needed to succeed in the IB Diploma Program. Within the DP, in addition to building the components of the IB learner profile, students also practice skills related to research, spoken and written expression and academic honesty. Some of the key subjects offered include English, Hindi, Economics, History, Spanish ab initio, French ab initio, Italian ab initio, Geography, Business Management, Environmental Systems and Societies, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Visual Arts, Theatre Arts, and Mathematics. All DP subjects offered are available in standard level (SL) and higher level (HL), including Further Mathematics HL. Although BDSIS is a non-selective school for admissions, the average IB score is 35 points with 20% of our students receiving 40 points or higher.

Although the main faculty body is Indian, the institution is focused on providing extensive opportunities for professional development to ensure, in turn, the optimal growth of a student’s personality and intellectual curiosity. The faculty consists of caring, creative, enthusiastic, open-minded and motivated individuals who aim to facilitate the process of learning through exploration and encouragement. Most teachers have earned training and credentials from local institutions with further training opportunities offered within the school via external workshops and professional conferences.

Mumbai
Although it is considered the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of India, Mumbai boasts a rich culture with historical roots dating back to the third century. The city is studded with historic sites, museums, art galleries, theatres, parks and beaches. Being one of the largest cities in the country, Mumbai offers a blend of traditional and international festivals, food, music and theatre. The city’s history as a major trading centre and as a city of migrants has led to a wide range of cultures, religions and cuisines coexisting together. This unique blend of diverse cultures and ideas has promoted an international, secular and welcoming atmosphere within the city. As a transportation hub, Mumbai offers easy access for explorations around India itself as well as South East Asia and the Middle East.
HEAD OF SCHOOL Position Description
The Head of School position at the B.D. Somani International School (BDSIS) is a new position for the school which, since its founding in 2006, has been led by two principals with responsibilities for Reception- Grade 5 (Primary Principal) and Grades 6-12 (Secondary Principal). BDSIS is governed by a Managing Board of Trustees with the ultimate responsibility for driving strategic decisions and managing the long-term future of the school.

Somani Board of Trustees which, in March of 2019, resulted in the selection of Dr. Geoff Fisher as Interim Head of School for 2019/20. Geoff Fisher’s appointment is separately announced under FILLED POSITIONS on the Search website. The search for a permanent Head of School for July of 2020 remains active and continues to represent a unique opportunity for leadership in this exceptional school. We invite candidates to take advantage of the gift of time and consider submitting their application for the permanent Head of School position to commence in July of 2020.
The School
The B.D. Somani International School (BDSIS) is a co-educational day school located in southern Mumbai. Currently, the school offers an international curriculum in English to over 1,000 students from the age of 3 to 18. Students are predominantly Indian and most have English as their first language. Founded in July 2006, BDSIS became the first school in southern Mumbai to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). Since then the school has successfully introduced the Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIS) for Grades 8 to 10. The lower grades use international progressive philosophy to prepare students for life-long learning and the IB Diploma.

The school attracts families who live throughout South Mumbai and desire an international education that predominantly leads to tertiary studies abroad. BDSIS has a Managing Board that currently bears the ultimate responsibility for the school and drives major policy, strategic and infrastructure decisions. The day-to-day activities are managed by two principals: Primary Principal (responsible for Reception to Grade 5) and Secondary Principal (responsible for Grades 6 to 12).
Located in one of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Mumbai, the school is situated at the nexus of history, culture and geography of the city. The school’s facilities include large, well-furnished classrooms; cutting edge laboratories; well-stocked libraries; art, music, theatre and sports facilities (including the largest school field in South Mumbai). The school aims to develop informed curiosity and a deep passion for learning among its students and faculty.

Vision and Mission
B.D. Somani International School offers its students an internationally recognised curriculum in an Indian setting. The school focuses on social as well as intellectual development of the students to equip them to take their place in the global community of the 21st century. In an atmosphere that values academic excellence, the school seeks to encourage respect for individuality and self-awareness. At B. D. Somani, we aim to nurture and develop the potential of each of our students and to prepare them to become dynamic, caring and productive members of a democratic and interdependent society.

Primary School
Within the Primary School, the curriculum is centred on building effective communication, collaborative problem-solving and reasoning skills. The learning environment requires practical application of skills, authentic and constructivist experiences, research, discussion and debate. The emphasis is on higher order thinking rather than simplistic rote learning. The arts, outdoor physical activity, IT skills and Hindi, French and Marathi are valued and embedded throughout the curriculum. As students move up to Middle School from Primary, they are confident, articulate and ready to take risks and face challenges whilst being equipped with the necessary skills to be life-long learners and thinkers.

Secondary School
In Secondary School, the curriculum is geared towards delivering a holistic education to all our students as they transition to classrooms with individual subjects taught by specialist teachers. As the students move on to the IGCSE program, there is an emphasis on research skills, teamwork and intellectual discovery. BDSIS offers a total of 18 IGCSE subjects out of which students study 8 subjects (4 mandatory and 4 optional). These subjects range from Science to Humanities to vocational subjects to provide a wide choice for all learners.

The school believes the IGCSE program to be the perfect bridge between the middle school and the IB Diploma Program. The curriculum gives students an opportunity to implement skills acquired in earlier years and to develop the traits and attitudes needed to succeed in the IB Diploma Program. Within the DP, in addition to building the components of the IB learner profile, students also practice skills related to research, spoken and written expression and academic honesty. Some of the key subjects offered include English, Hindi, Economics, History, Spanish ab initio, French ab initio, Italian ab initio, Geography, Business Management, Environmental Systems and Societies, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Visual Arts, Theatre Arts, and Mathematics. All DP subjects offered are available in standard level (SL) and higher level (HL), including Further Mathematics HL. Although BDSIS is a non-selective school for admissions, the average IB score is 35 points with 20% of our students receiving 40 points or higher.

Although the main faculty body is Indian, the institution is focused on providing extensive opportunities for professional development to ensure, in turn, the optimal growth of a student’s personality and intellectual curiosity. The faculty consists of caring, creative, enthusiastic, open-minded and motivated individuals who aim to facilitate the process of learning through exploration and encouragement. Most teachers have earned training and credentials from local institutions with further training opportunities offered within the school via external workshops and professional conferences.

Mumbai
Although it is considered the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of India, Mumbai boasts a rich culture with historical roots dating back to the third century. The city is studded with historic sites, museums, art galleries, theatres, parks and beaches. Being one of the largest cities in the country, Mumbai offers a blend of traditional and international festivals, food, music and theatre. The city’s history as a major trading centre and as a city of migrants has led to a wide range of cultures, religions and cuisines coexisting together. This unique blend of diverse cultures and ideas has promoted an international, secular and welcoming atmosphere within the city. As a transportation hub, Mumbai offers easy access for explorations around India itself as well as South East Asia and the Middle East.

In December of 2018, the search for the Secondary Principal was completed with the appointment of Dr. Colleen Boyett who will assume her role in July of 2019 (see the announcement on the Search website). In addition, since the re-launching of the search for 2020, an Interim Head appointment for 2019/20 was explored by the B.D. Somani Board of Trustees which, in March of 2019, resulted in the selection of Dr. Geoff Fisher as Interim Head of School for 2019/20. Geoff Fisher’s appointment is separately announced under FILLED POSITIONS on the Search website. The search for a permanent Head of School for July of 2020 remains active and continues to represent a unique opportunity for leadership in this exceptional school. We invite candidates to take advantage of the gift of time and consider submitting their application for the permanent Head of School position to commence in July of 2020.
The School
The B.D. Somani International School (BDSIS) is a co-educational day school located in southern Mumbai. Currently, the school offers an international curriculum in English to over 1,000 students from the age of 3 to 18. Students are predominantly Indian and most have English as their first language. Founded in July 2006, BDSIS became the first school in southern Mumbai to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). Since then the school has successfully introduced the Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIS) for Grades 8 to 10. The lower grades use international progressive philosophy to prepare students for life-long learning and the IB Diploma.

The school attracts families who live throughout South Mumbai and desire an international education that predominantly leads to tertiary studies abroad. BDSIS has a Managing Board that currently bears the ultimate responsibility for the school and drives major policy, strategic and infrastructure decisions. The day-to-day activities are managed by two principals: Primary Principal (responsible for Reception to Grade 5) and Secondary Principal (responsible for Grades 6 to 12).
Located in one of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Mumbai, the school is situated at the nexus of history, culture and geography of the city. The school’s facilities include large, well-furnished classrooms; cutting edge laboratories; well-stocked libraries; art, music, theatre and sports facilities (including the largest school field in South Mumbai). The school aims to develop informed curiosity and a deep passion for learning among its students and faculty.

Vision and Mission
B.D. Somani International School offers its students an internationally recognised curriculum in an Indian setting. The school focuses on social as well as intellectual development of the students to equip them to take their place in the global community of the 21st century. In an atmosphere that values academic excellence, the school seeks to encourage respect for individuality and self-awareness. At B. D. Somani, we aim to nurture and develop the potential of each of our students and to prepare them to become dynamic, caring and productive members of a democratic and interdependent society.

Primary School
Within the Primary School, the curriculum is centred on building effective communication, collaborative problem-solving and reasoning skills. The learning environment requires practical application of skills, authentic and constructivist experiences, research, discussion and debate. The emphasis is on higher order thinking rather than simplistic rote learning. The arts, outdoor physical activity, IT skills and Hindi, French and Marathi are valued and embedded throughout the curriculum. As students move up to Middle School from Primary, they are confident, articulate and ready to take risks and face challenges whilst being equipped with the necessary skills to be life-long learners and thinkers.

Secondary School
In Secondary School, the curriculum is geared towards delivering a holistic education to all our students as they transition to classrooms with individual subjects taught by specialist teachers. As the students move on to the IGCSE program, there is an emphasis on research skills, teamwork and intellectual discovery. BDSIS offers a total of 18 IGCSE subjects out of which students study 8 subjects (4 mandatory and 4 optional). These subjects range from Science to Humanities to vocational subjects to provide a wide choice for all learners.

The school believes the IGCSE program to be the perfect bridge between the middle school and the IB Diploma Program. The curriculum gives students an opportunity to implement skills acquired in earlier years and to develop the traits and attitudes needed to succeed in the IB Diploma Program. Within the DP, in addition to building the components of the IB learner profile, students also practice skills related to research, spoken and written expression and academic honesty. Some of the key subjects offered include English, Hindi, Economics, History, Spanish ab initio, French ab initio, Italian ab initio, Geography, Business Management, Environmental Systems and Societies, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Visual Arts, Theatre Arts, and Mathematics. All DP subjects offered are available in standard level (SL) and higher level (HL), including Further Mathematics HL. Although BDSIS is a non-selective school for admissions, the average IB score is 35 points with 20% of our students receiving 40 points or higher.

Although the main faculty body is Indian, the institution is focused on providing extensive opportunities for professional development to ensure, in turn, the optimal growth of a student’s personality and intellectual curiosity. The faculty consists of caring, creative, enthusiastic, open-minded and motivated individuals who aim to facilitate the process of learning through exploration and encouragement. Most teachers have earned training and credentials from local institutions with further training opportunities offered within the school via external workshops and professional conferences.

Mumbai
Although it is considered the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of India, Mumbai boasts a rich culture with historical roots dating back to the third century. The city is studded with historic sites, museums, art galleries, theatres, parks and beaches. Being one of the largest cities in the country, Mumbai offers a blend of traditional and international festivals, food, music and theatre. The city’s history as a major trading centre and as a city of migrants has led to a wide range of cultures, religions and cuisines coexisting together. This unique blend of diverse cultures and ideas has promoted an international, secular and welcoming atmosphere within the city. As a transportation hub, Mumbai offers easy access for explorations around India itself as well as South East Asia and the Middle East.

In order to create the opportunity for a more comprehensive search that will produce a highly experienced group of candidates, Search Associates and the BDSIS Board have agreed to RE-LAUNCH THE SEARCH for the first-ever Head of School for 2020. In December of 2018, the search for the Secondary Principal was completed with the appointment of Dr. Colleen Boyett who will assume her role in July of 2019 (see the announcement on the Search website). In addition, since the re-launching of the search for 2020, an Interim Head appointment for 2019/20 was explored by the B.D. Somani Board of Trustees which, in March of 2019, resulted in the selection of Dr. Geoff Fisher as Interim Head of School for 2019/20. Geoff Fisher’s appointment is separately announced under FILLED POSITIONS on the Search website. The search for a permanent Head of School for July of 2020 remains active and continues to represent a unique opportunity for leadership in this exceptional school. We invite candidates to take advantage of the gift of time and consider submitting their application for the permanent Head of School position to commence in July of 2020.
The School
The B.D. Somani International School (BDSIS) is a co-educational day school located in southern Mumbai. Currently, the school offers an international curriculum in English to over 1,000 students from the age of 3 to 18. Students are predominantly Indian and most have English as their first language. Founded in July 2006, BDSIS became the first school in southern Mumbai to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). Since then the school has successfully introduced the Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIS) for Grades 8 to 10. The lower grades use international progressive philosophy to prepare students for life-long learning and the IB Diploma.

The school attracts families who live throughout South Mumbai and desire an international education that predominantly leads to tertiary studies abroad. BDSIS has a Managing Board that currently bears the ultimate responsibility for the school and drives major policy, strategic and infrastructure decisions. The day-to-day activities are managed by two principals: Primary Principal (responsible for Reception to Grade 5) and Secondary Principal (responsible for Grades 6 to 12).
Located in one of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Mumbai, the school is situated at the nexus of history, culture and geography of the city. The school’s facilities include large, well-furnished classrooms; cutting edge laboratories; well-stocked libraries; art, music, theatre and sports facilities (including the largest school field in South Mumbai). The school aims to develop informed curiosity and a deep passion for learning among its students and faculty.

Vision and Mission
B.D. Somani International School offers its students an internationally recognised curriculum in an Indian setting. The school focuses on social as well as intellectual development of the students to equip them to take their place in the global community of the 21st century. In an atmosphere that values academic excellence, the school seeks to encourage respect for individuality and self-awareness. At B. D. Somani, we aim to nurture and develop the potential of each of our students and to prepare them to become dynamic, caring and productive members of a democratic and interdependent society.

Primary School
Within the Primary School, the curriculum is centred on building effective communication, collaborative problem-solving and reasoning skills. The learning environment requires practical application of skills, authentic and constructivist experiences, research, discussion and debate. The emphasis is on higher order thinking rather than simplistic rote learning. The arts, outdoor physical activity, IT skills and Hindi, French and Marathi are valued and embedded throughout the curriculum. As students move up to Middle School from Primary, they are confident, articulate and ready to take risks and face challenges whilst being equipped with the necessary skills to be life-long learners and thinkers.

Secondary School
In Secondary School, the curriculum is geared towards delivering a holistic education to all our students as they transition to classrooms with individual subjects taught by specialist teachers. As the students move on to the IGCSE program, there is an emphasis on research skills, teamwork and intellectual discovery. BDSIS offers a total of 18 IGCSE subjects out of which students study 8 subjects (4 mandatory and 4 optional). These subjects range from Science to Humanities to vocational subjects to provide a wide choice for all learners.

The school believes the IGCSE program to be the perfect bridge between the middle school and the IB Diploma Program. The curriculum gives students an opportunity to implement skills acquired in earlier years and to develop the traits and attitudes needed to succeed in the IB Diploma Program. Within the DP, in addition to building the components of the IB learner profile, students also practice skills related to research, spoken and written expression and academic honesty. Some of the key subjects offered include English, Hindi, Economics, History, Spanish ab initio, French ab initio, Italian ab initio, Geography, Business Management, Environmental Systems and Societies, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Visual Arts, Theatre Arts, and Mathematics. All DP subjects offered are available in standard level (SL) and higher level (HL), including Further Mathematics HL. Although BDSIS is a non-selective school for admissions, the average IB score is 35 points with 20% of our students receiving 40 points or higher.

Although the main faculty body is Indian, the institution is focused on providing extensive opportunities for professional development to ensure, in turn, the optimal growth of a student’s personality and intellectual curiosity. The faculty consists of caring, creative, enthusiastic, open-minded and motivated individuals who aim to facilitate the process of learning through exploration and encouragement. Most teachers have earned training and credentials from local institutions with further training opportunities offered within the school via external workshops and professional conferences.

Mumbai
Although it is considered the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of India, Mumbai boasts a rich culture with historical roots dating back to the third century. The city is studded with historic sites, museums, art galleries, theatres, parks and beaches. Being one of the largest cities in the country, Mumbai offers a blend of traditional and international festivals, food, music and theatre. The city’s history as a major trading centre and as a city of migrants has led to a wide range of cultures, religions and cuisines coexisting together. This unique blend of diverse cultures and ideas has promoted an international, secular and welcoming atmosphere within the city. As a transportation hub, Mumbai offers easy access for explorations around India itself as well as South East Asia and the Middle East.
